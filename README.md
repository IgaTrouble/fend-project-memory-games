## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

##
THE RULES FOR PLAYING "MEMORY"
Clock on and turn over any two cards.
If the two cards match, it is your success. 
If they don't match, they will turn back over.
Remember what was on each card and where it was.
The game is over when all the cards have been matched.
The less your moves the better your score.
